DessertClicker
=====================

In this app, each time the user taps a dessert on the screen, the app "purchases" the dessert for the user. The app updates values in the layout for the number of desserts that were purchased, and for the total amount the user spent.

This app demonstrates the Android lifecycle and how to log messages to
the Android console (Logcat).
